It contains the book and its code samples. **Design Patterns**, is the first in the The Learn'd Developer Series—a series of books aimed at developers that want to hone their craft.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nIt is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License. \r\n\r\n## Viewing \r\n\r\nWe regenerate the book often. See the files named:\r\nthe-learn-d-developer-design-patterns.xxx (where _xxx_ is the file\r\nextension).\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nTo generate the book in all formats simply type the following from the\r\nproject's root directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake all \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Makefile itself is pretty descriptive and should get you going\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n## Source code\r\n\r\nThe source code for the book is all in the ./resources directory. As the\r\ncode uses TDD you will find the following useful for running the tests:\r\n\r\n### Java\r\n\r\nFor any Java source code, the unit tests were done using [JUnit4][junit]\r\nin [Eclpise][eclipse]. Also, any test doubles use [Mockito][mockito].\r\n\r\n### PHP\r\n\r\nFor any PHP source code, the unit tests were done using [phpunit][php_unit].\r\n\r\n### JavaScript\r\n\r\nFor any JavaScript source code, the unit tests were done using [mocha.js][mocha]. Also, any test doubles use [sinon.js][sinon].\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contribution guidelines\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome. Please see both the book's Preface and, of\r\ncourse, any issues in the github issue tracker.\r\n\r\n## Special acknowledgements\r\n\r\nI feel obliged to commend Addy Osmani on his countless community contributions, particularly in developer education, and acknowledge that seeing the impact of his works inspired me to write myself. Also, the book: [Essential JS Design Patterns][addy] is where I shamelessly lifted the slightly tweaked pandoc build process being used here! \r\n\r\n\r\n[addy]: https://github.com/addyosmani\r\n[sinon]: http://sinonjs.org/\r\n[mocha]: http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/\r\n[eclipse]: http://www.eclipse.org/\r\n[mockito]: http://code.google.com/p/mockito/\r\n[junit]: https://github.com/KentBeck/junit\r\n[php_unit]:https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/\r\n","google":"","name":"the-learn-d-developer-design-patterns"}
